# Part I — The First Ember and the Shaping of the Sea Beneath

They say, in the emberlight’s oldest flicker, that the world was not made in the open air.  
It was born in silence and stone.

It began when a fragment of the sun — the First Ember — fell into a cavern vast beyond sight. The stone cracked around it, and from the split came warmth so pure that the air shivered. The cavern roof glittered with mineral frost, melting to drops that fell into steaming pools. These swelled and joined until the Underground Sea was born, its shores jagged and black, its water breathing mist in the heat.

When the Ember blazed in its first strength, the water hissed and the rock sweated iron. Fish without eyes leapt from the warmth, their scales shimmering like opal in the glow. The very walls pulsed with light, carrying a deep hum — a vibration felt in the bones, as if the cavern itself had a heartbeat.

The Ember’s glow spread in waves. Air stirred and carried the smell of warm stone, of iron-rich water, and of something sweet — a resinous perfume drawn from the rock itself. To walk near the Ember was to feel heat roll across your skin like a tide, soaking into the bones.

**In-world Artefact — Emberkeepers’ Chant (full form)**  
*In the deep we drink the light,  
Ash to ash, ember to sight.  
Warmth to hands, breath to stone,  
We keep the fire, we guard the bone.  
Hold it close and guard it well,  
Lest the hollow learn to swell.*

## The First People of the Ember

From the tunnels came the first wanderers. They wore furs stitched with sinew and painted their faces with ash to mark themselves as children of the Ember. They traded their names for warmth, for food cooked over the Ember’s breath. They told each other that to touch the cavern floor was to touch the edge of the sun.

In those days, life orbited the Ember.  
Raft-villages were anchored close to the shore, each raft tied to the next with rope that sang in the heat. Nets were lowered into water that still steamed, drawing fish fat from the mineral-rich currents. Cliffside hollows were cut for sleeping, their floors lined with hides and heated stones wrapped in woven kelp.

At night, the glow painted the cavern ceiling in molten gold. Even the smallest ripples on the water caught the light, throwing shifting fire across the black walls. The air was thick with the scent of cooked fish and boiling herb-broth. Laughter carried across the water, unafraid of what might hear.

**Overheard in a cliffside market (early age)**  
*"The fish come fat this season — see the silver on their skin? That’s Ember-fed."*  
*"Keep them fresh, girl, before the glow fades. Nothing spoils faster than the Ember’s gift."*

## The First Shadows

But heat cannot hold forever.  
Slowly, without warning, the Ember’s colour deepened from gold to copper. The air lost its shimmer. The Underground Sea, once swirling with warm currents, began to cool at the edges. Raft-villagers spoke of a faint ache in the bones when they swam too far from the Ember’s heart.

The first frost appeared in thin lace along the rock, melting at the day’s warmth — until one day it did not. The frost stayed, glinting blue in the fading light. Fungus began to creep closer to the Ember’s edge, pale and soft, its glow faint but steady.

**In-world Artefact — The Cooling Song**  
*Once we burned, once we sang,  
Now the cold hangs fang to fang.  
Keep the ropes, guard the flame,  
Call the Ember by its name.*  

---

With the cooling came small changes that grew into a new way of life.  
The smell of burning lichen replaced the tang of steam. Voices dropped in pitch; laughter became a quiet thing, shared in close circles. Fishers learned to follow the warm currents still bleeding from the Ember’s heart and to avoid the black, stillwater where the heat had died entirely.

## The Shaping of Peoples and Places

By the Second Cooling, the cavern’s people were many.  
Raft-villages formed long chains across sheltered bays, each raft with its own ring of cooking fires. Cliffside settlements rose in tiers, connected by ladders swaying over the water. Farther from the Ember, the half-flooded tunnels filled with dwellings carved into rock above the tide-line, their walls dark with fungus smoke.

Daily life bent around the shrinking warmth. Where once fish were grilled over stones heated by the Ember’s breath, they were now boiled in broth of fungus and salt. Hands grew raw from lichen-picking; children’s first tasks were gathering ropeweed to twist into cord. The smell of smoke and boiling broth became the smell of home.

*Two nets redfish — four coils rope — one basket greencap — three ashstones (spent).*

## The Waning into Myth

By the Third Cooling, the Ember’s light reached only the waters nearest its shore. Fires became the true measure of wealth, and ash from burnt lichen was saved in clay jars for trade. Ash was believed to carry the Ember’s memory; it was rubbed into rope to keep it from rotting, smeared on skin for warmth, and sprinkled in the hearth to bless a meal.

Stories began to drift. Some said the Ember had been a gift from the gods above; others claimed it was stolen from the core of the world by trickster spirits. Each telling added a layer, like silt on the sea floor, until truth itself was buried.

In the raft-markets, traders sold charms to “catch the Ember’s last breath” — bone pendants warmed in the fire before being worn. Parents told children to keep them under their pillows, to dream of the First Summer’s warmth.

The First Age ended not with the Ember’s death, but with its folding into myth.  
Its light was now one fire among many, its warmth a memory traded in whispers. And far beyond the cavern’s edge, unseen and unheeded, the shadows that would shape the Age of Umbra began to gather.
