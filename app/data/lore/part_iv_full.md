# Part IV — The Descent into the Present

## Subchapter 1: The Shard-Wars

They say the dust from the tunnel collapse hung in Dornhal’s air for a week, fine enough to turn torchlight the colour of rust. Children coughed it from their lungs for months after, and the cobblestones kept their reddish film until the next year’s rains. The collapse didn’t just bury the tunnel — it buried the promise of the Ascent, and with it, whatever fragile unity the Last Kingdom had held together.

The first fighting began before the dust had even settled. Not for the tunnel itself — no one had the means to dig it clear — but for what it had meant. Control of the Cyrinth Fragment became the symbol of legitimacy: whoever held it could claim to be the rightful heir to Queen Rhenn’s dream.

The Hall of Memory, where the Fragment had been displayed, sealed its great copper doors. The guards who had once worn the Queen’s sun-and-sea crest now claimed to serve “the Queen’s will,” though no one could prove she still lived. Captains from across the fractured realm sent envoys to bargain — brightstone, food stores, promises of safe passage — but every offer was refused.

When words failed, knives came out. The first raid on the Hall left two guards dead and three attackers hanging by their necks from the rope-bridge at Outer Gate. From there, the fighting spread.

**Life under the early Shard-Wars**  
In the narrow streets of Dornhal’s Lower Quarter, people learned to keep their shutters closed after nightfall. Lanterns were hooded so their light wouldn’t draw archers’ attention. The smell of the city changed: less of the usual wet rope and riverweed, more of burnt lard and the acrid smoke of oil-fires used to drive opponents from choke-points.

Markets became dangerous places. Salt-fish from the lower caverns, once sold in neat plaited strings, now came wrapped in greasy paper with the vendor’s own mark burned into it — proof it hadn’t been stolen from a rival clan’s storehouse. Gold coins lost their shine; you couldn’t eat them, and no one trusted a mint when the dies could be seized by force.

Some households hid their wealth in flour jars, or salted it away — literally — inside barrels of brine to disguise it from looters. Others packed up entirely, fleeing to the smaller lake-towns in the outlying caverns, where the air smelled of fungus hearths instead of blood and tallow.

**Notable figures of the first campaigns**  
- Captain Serrol Vale, known as the “Rope-Crow,” who strung his enemies from half-built siege scaffolds as a warning.  
- Mistress Deren of the Lantern-Market, whose network of traders smuggled food and lamp-oil through enemy lines in false-bottom carts.  
- Haskel the Whitehand, a healer who treated fighters from both sides — and was eventually found drowned in the shallows, hands bound with his own bandages.

**The Fragment’s disappearance**  
Six months into the war, the guards of the Hall announced that the Cyrinth Fragment had been “moved for safekeeping.” No one saw it again. The copper doors stayed locked, and the guards began wearing a new livery: black sashes embroidered with a silver knot. To some, this meant a hidden patron had claimed the Fragment. To others, it was proof that it had already been lost or destroyed.

Rumours swirled. Some claimed the Fragment had been smuggled to a shrine in the kelp-forests of the lower Sea. Others swore it had been shattered and its shards scattered among the captains to prevent any one of them from claiming supremacy.

**The war widens**  
By the second year, the Shard-Wars were no longer about the Fragment alone. Petty captains settled old debts under its cover. Guilds withheld goods unless their rivals’ ships were seized. Mercenary bands swapped allegiance three or four times in a season, their banners painted over with each change.

The fighting was rarely in open fields. Instead, it was rope-bridge ambushes in the mist, burning an enemy’s storehouse during a festival, bribing a rival’s ferrymen to cut the moorings. The sound of boots on stone could mean anything — a neighbour returning home, or a press-gang on its way to fill the ranks.

**Signs of a deeper rot**  
By the third year, whispers spoke of captains who had begun selling not only their swords but their dead. Corpses fetched in the night, funeral boats intercepted and never seen again. No one said where they went, but a few merchants swore they had seen pale, waterlogged figures walking in step behind shadowed leaders. Those who had lived through the Age of Umbra’s last days began to murmur that the smell of the streets — rotting fish, wood-smoke, and the sharp tang of quicklime in the grave-pits — felt too much like a warning.

## Subchapter 2: The Veil Compact

By the fifth winter of the Shard-Wars, Dornhal was exhausted. Rope-bridges sagged under frost, unmaintained; markets stood half-empty even at midday. The price of lamp-oil had trebled, and it was common to see entire districts walking home by the light of a single borrowed torch. People stopped asking who held the Cyrinth Fragment — the fight had swallowed the question itself.

It was in this weariness that the first envoys of the Veil Compact appeared. They came not in bright banners, but in grey wool cloaks stitched with the image of a knotted veil. Their pitch was simple: an end to the raids, open markets again, and a unified defence against “emerging threats” — a phrase that could mean anything from food shortages to the whispered trade in corpses.

The name “Veil” was meant to suggest both concealment from outside enemies and a wedding between former foes. Its architects claimed that any realm who signed would be bound to aid all others in the event of necromantic incursion.

**Formation and key figures**  
The Compact was formally signed in the Hall of Nets, a riverside trading hall whose high windows smelled of mildew and salt. Present were six major captains and three guild-chiefs:  
- Captain Serrol Vale, newly returned from the lower caverns with a fleet of grain-barges.  
- Guildmother Tren Mair, master of the Ferrymen’s Guild, whose influence could choke or flood any market.  
- Archscribe Lerris Dan, who penned the Veil Charter in ink laced with ash, a symbolic ward against deceit.

In the weeks that followed, the Compact’s mark — a grey knotted veil — began to appear on warehouse doors and ferry-barges. Compact markets were patrolled by mixed crews, each man or woman wearing a strip of grey cloth somewhere on their person.

**Life under the Veil**  
For the first time in years, it was possible to walk from the Stone Quay to the Rope Quarter without passing a checkpoint. The first day the barricades came down, children darted across the square in games of chase, their bare feet slapping the cobbles. The smell of yeast returned to the bakeries, as ovens that had been cold for months began turning out rounds of flatbread dusted with salt and fennel seed.

Markets bustled again. In the Hall of Nets, dried sea-fruit hung from rafters, their skins wrinkled and fragrant, and new-caught eels were sold still twitching in wicker traps. Net-weavers sat cross-legged in the open, repairing gear without fear of sudden raids. The air was filled with the creak of pulley lines and the rhythmic chant of dockers hauling cargo.

Refugees from the outer caverns arrived in slow, steady trickles — not desperate mobs, but tired families. They carried what they could in net bags, clay jars of preserved kelp, and patched crates of possessions wrapped in waterproof skins. The Compact issued them temporary market tokens: thin wooden chits branded with the veil-knot, allowing access to grain stores and lamp-oil without fear of being turned away at a checkpoint.

Compact markets were patrolled by mixed crews — sailors from rival captains now walking side-by-side, their grey cloth strips worn as armbands, sashes, or tied to spear-shafts. At first, their patrols were cautious, watching one another as much as the crowds. Over time, grudging camaraderie grew in shared routines: swapping cups of spiced shellfish broth on cold nights, helping each other haul drunken merchants out of the canal water.

Taverns revived old songs, but voices carried differently now — not the raw-throated defiance of wartime drinking, but the tentative, quiet harmonies of people relearning to sing together. In the evenings, lantern-light pooled golden over the water instead of guttering from a lone guarded torch.

Yet it was a peace with limits. Every transaction was recorded in the Veil ledgers, every grain ration marked, and every mixed crew reported nightly to the Compact council. People said you could walk safely again, yes — but you also walked under watch.

**Fractures begin to show**  
The first crack appeared in the western port of Selvarn. A shipment of lamp-oil bound for the Rope Quarter — thirty casks — never arrived. Witnesses swore they saw the barge turn down a blackwater channel known for its blind bends and disappear into the mist. Selvarn’s representatives claimed the cargo had been “commandeered for security purposes,” but refused to elaborate. The rumour in the markets was that the casks had been traded to a shadow-merchant for weapons.

Compact patrols began to notice their grey cloth marks being defaced — cut in half, slashed diagonally, or replaced with the old clan symbols they were meant to replace. In the Lower Quay, a brawl between two mixed crews ended with three dead and a half-dozen wounded; the official report blamed “miscommunication,” but the tavern talk blamed old debts resurfacing.

Two months later came the most notorious incident: a Compact patrol in the lower docks found dead at dawn. There were six bodies, each wearing a different captain’s livery, each killed by a different method — one with a slit throat, another by crossbow, a third drowned. It was too clean to be coincidence. The Compact’s spokesmen insisted it was the work of necromancer agents, pointing to pale marks on the drowned man’s wrists, but others suspected an elaborate message from one of the signatories: *the Veil cannot bind us*.

There were smaller signs too, the kind only those paying close attention noticed. Market tolls began to rise again in certain districts “for maintenance costs.” Ferrymen with Compact passes found themselves stopped on routes that had been open weeks before. Dockside bribes crept back into the price of doing business.

By the second year, whole neighbourhoods treated the grey armband as optional. In Selvarn and the Iron Quarters, it became common to see mixed crews patrolling with their armbands tucked away, carrying themselves more like enforcers for a particular captain than representatives of the Compact. The grey cloth that had once promised safety was becoming another uniform of power, its meaning changing with every alley and market stall.

**The collapse**  
The Veil Compact unravelled in its third year. Guildmother Tren Mair was assassinated — a crossbow bolt from the rigging of her own flagship during a market day. Without her to manage the ferries, rival captains began seizing control of the routes. In the same season, two key members of the Compact were caught in a smuggling scheme involving uncremated bodies from plague wards.

By the end of that winter, the grey-cloth strips had been torn from market doors, and mixed crews had dissolved into their original factions. The ferrymen went back to charging tolls at swordpoint, and the old checkpoint barricades rose again across the Rope Quarter.

**Legacy**  
Even in its failure, the Veil Compact left marks. Certain patrol routes established in those years became the backbone of later defences. Some captains still used the Compact’s coded signals to negotiate safe passage when official politics failed. And for a brief window, people remembered what it was like to walk a street without wondering if the torchlight ahead was a friend’s or an enemy’s.

## Subchapter 3: The Famine Years

The famine did not arrive all at once. It came in signs small enough to be ignored, at least at first: fewer eels in the nets, fungus hearths yielding lighter harvests, grain shipments delayed. By the time anyone named it a famine, the rot was already in the roots.

The first bad season followed a summer of floods in the upper caverns. Freshwater that should have trickled evenly through the stone poured in torrents, stripping away fertile silt and collapsing small tunnel farms. The lower market’s fishmongers began selling half-grown catch at full price. Dried kelp strips — once sold in bundles thick as a wrist — grew narrow and brittle.

Salt caravans from the far tunnels failed to arrive. Without salt, meat spoiled in days, and pickled stores turned sour in their jars. The smell of vinegar and rot clung to whole districts. Families sold heirlooms for a sack of barley, and even that barley often came infested with black mould that stained the hands of those who handled it.

**Everyday life in scarcity**  
Cooking fires burned low, conserving fuel. Stew-pots were stretched with more water and fewer scraps of meat; bread was cut thin and eaten with broth to fill the belly. In poorer quarters, rats and cave-crabs became common fare, though both carried the risk of sickness.

Taverns replaced ale with a thin, bitter brew made from boiled lichen and fungus yeast. The flavour was sharp and earthy, leaving a chalky taste on the tongue. Children learned to chew dried fungus strips as if they were sweets.

The famine changed the streets too. Where once the air had smelled of wood-smoke and roasting fish, it now carried the faint ammonia tang of fermenting fungus vats and the sourness of unwashed bodies — baths were a luxury when water had to be boiled for drinking.

**Political consequences**  
The Compact’s failure had left no single authority to coordinate relief. Captains hoarded stores, claiming they were for “the defence of their own people,” while sending agents to raid less-defended granaries. Guilds with access to food or lamp-oil became as powerful as warlords.

The Grain Riots of Dornhal began when a shipment from the outer caverns arrived at Stone Quay and was claimed in full by Captain Rusk Merrow’s men. Crowds swarmed the quay, pelting the guards with stones and bits of broken pottery. Merrow’s men answered with crossbows. Eight were killed before the quay was cleared; the survivors were driven into the shallows, where the black water closed over their heads.

Rumours spread that certain captains were accepting necromancer “assistance” — food in exchange for service. Few believed the food came without a price, and some whispered that it was drawn from stores in which the grain sacks moved faintly, as if breathing.

**Adaptations and survival**  
Not all responses were cruel. In the Rope Quarter, a coalition of small traders set up shared tables: long planks laid across crates, where anyone could drop food scraps to be made into communal stews. The smell of these stews — strange mixes of fish, barley, mushroom, and whatever spices could be begged — became a marker of hope in the cold streets.

Some ferrymen began trading free passage for stories or songs, a strange barter born from the idea that memory, at least, could be fed when the body could not. Others smuggled food under loads of scrap metal or stone, risking arrest at every checkpoint.

**The breaking point**  
The famine reached its cruelest in the third year. Entire districts in the western caverns were abandoned, their hearths cold, their walls marked with the chalk sign for plague — whether sickness had struck or not. The number of paupers buried without rites doubled, then tripled.

It was during this winter that the necromancer Bone Courts made their first open forays into the city. Cloaked envoys arrived at night, offering bread that never went stale, in exchange for service to “the coming order.” Some took the bargain. Others spat in the envoys’ faces. The ones who refused often vanished soon after.

By spring, the famine’s worst had passed, but the damage was permanent: population thinned, trust eroded, and the Bone Courts no longer whispered at the city’s edge — they had a foothold.

---

## Subchapter 4: The Rise of the Bone Courts

1. In the famine’s waning days, the Bone Courts were still just a rumour — a name muttered when children vanished, or when a night’s fog carried the sound of bells from no visible source. People said they were necromancers, yes, but also something older, something that had waited through the wars and the hunger for its moment to step forward.
2. Their first gifts came in plain cloth sacks: bread that never staled, meat that stayed red in the salt for weeks. Those who ate it swore it tasted like any other food, though some claimed it left a faint sweetness on the tongue, like the memory of fruit. No one asked too loudly where it came from.
3. The Bone Courts never sent soldiers in these early days. Instead, they sent envoys: pale figures cloaked in oil-black leather, faces hidden by bone masks carved with curling patterns. Each mask was different — some snarled, some smiled, some wept — but all had empty eyes.
4. An envoy would arrive in a market at dusk, stand in silence until a crowd formed, then offer their bargain: sustenance, protection, medicine. In return — “allegiance to the Courts” — a phrase left deliberately undefined.
5. At first, only the desperate accepted. Fishermen whose nets came up empty for weeks, mothers with sick children, dock-workers too weak from hunger to haul rope. They were marked subtly: a ring of pale ash daubed on the inside of the wrist.
6. Those marked were never seen begging again. They wore better clothes, ate better meals, and walked the streets at night without fear. But their eyes were often distant, their skin cool to the touch even in the heat of the fungus hearths.
7. The first House of the Bone Courts was established in the old Silk Guildhall, a building long abandoned after the guild’s collapse in the Shard-Wars. Its shutters were nailed shut, and its only door replaced by a bone-inlaid arch. No one saw the renovations take place — one day it was a ruin, the next it stood whole.
8. From there, the Courts began holding audiences. Petitioners would queue at dusk, and the doors would open only when the sky outside turned completely black. No one but the petitioner was admitted, and no one spoke of what happened inside.
9. The city’s captains disagreed on how to respond. Some, like Rusk Merrow, declared the Courts an open threat and tried to bar their envoys from the markets. Others saw opportunity in the Courts’ resources, cutting quiet deals to supply them with “raw materials” — unclaimed dead, condemned criminals, debtors with no kin.
10. It was during these manoeuvres that the first Bone Barges appeared on the waterways. Narrow, flat-hulled vessels rowed in utter silence by masked oarsmen, they moved without lamps, yet never struck a wall or bridge.
11. One night in the Rope Quarter, a Bone Barge moored beside a warehouse that had been abandoned for months. By dawn, the building’s windows were lit from within by pale, steady light — and by evening, it bore the same bone-inlaid arch as the Silk Guildhall.
12. This second House began offering “employment”: carrying messages, guarding shipments, maintaining ledgers. The pay was generous, the food plentiful, and the tasks oddly easy — until someone failed. Those who did were escorted inside the House and never seen again.
13. By now, the Bone Courts’ presence was unmistakable. Their masked envoys began appearing at public executions, offering to “take the body where it belongs.” The practice spread until almost no corpse was left to the river or the grave-pits without first being offered to the Courts.
14. Merchants who dealt with them claimed the Courts paid in perfect silver coins, unstamped but heavy and pure. Some swore the coins felt faintly warm, as if they had been held in a living hand moments before.
15. The smell of their Houses became a thing people spoke of — not rot, as might be expected, but an odd mingling of myrrh, damp stone, and something faintly metallic, like fresh blood on cold iron.
16. Resistance began to take shape. The Lantern-Market traders formed the Ash Circle, a loose alliance committed to refusing all Bone Court goods. They spread leaflets warning that to eat their food was to “let them in,” though no one could say exactly what that meant.
17. The Ash Circle’s stand lasted until the Lantern Fire — a blaze that consumed three market streets in one night. Witnesses swore they saw a Bone Barge slip away from the quay just before the fire began, though no proof was ever found.
18. After that, the Courts no longer worked only through quiet bargains. Their Retainers — unmasked men and women in dark coats — began walking patrols in certain districts, moving with the same eerie precision as their masked masters. They carried bone-handled weapons that cut as cleanly through rope as through flesh.
19. Some districts welcomed the Retainers. Crime vanished where they walked, and their justice was swift. A pickpocket might be seized one day and gone the next, their stall replaced with one selling Court-approved goods.
20. In poorer quarters, Retainers began distributing pale tokens — small, polished discs of bone. To carry one was to be exempt from tolls and taxes in Court-controlled streets. Those caught without one could be stopped, searched, or “invited” to speak with an envoy.
21. The Courts’ control expanded not in sweeping conquests, but in tiny, permanent advances: one dock, then the next; a row of houses whose rents they quietly bought out; a warehouse converted into a House without public announcement.
22. By the second year of their rise, there were five known Houses in Dornhal alone. Each had its own mask style, coin mint, and favoured Retainers — but all answered to the same unseen Court Lords, whose names were never spoken aloud.
23. Rumours of what lay inside the Houses grew stranger. Some claimed vast banquet halls, others endless shelves of books bound in skin, or gardens where pale flowers bloomed under no visible light. One dockworker swore he saw a skeletal figure writing in a ledger that used no ink, only the slow bleeding of the page itself.
24. Necromantic craft became a visible part of daily life. The Bone Courts began selling laboured dead: corpses that could carry loads, haul nets, or pump bellows, each with the same bone-white mask and slow, deliberate movements.
25. To some, these labourers were a miracle — tireless, obedient, needing no food. To others, they were an obscenity, a reminder that death no longer drew a firm boundary between neighbour and servant.
26. The city’s festivals changed. The Courts introduced The Quiet Feast, a night when no music was played, no bells were rung, and tables were laid with food they provided. Those who attended said the taste was exquisite, but no one could name the spices, and every guest was marked with the same pale ash-ring.
27. Not all who entered the Courts’ service were coerced. Young clerks, failed apprentices, and out-of-work guards found steady pay, fine clothes, and protection. To wear a Court livery was to walk unchallenged, even in districts hostile to them.
28. But those same courtiers were rumoured to age strangely — some seeming older within a year, others not changing at all over a decade. Whispers spread that service to the Courts did not merely buy protection; it altered the bargain of time itself.
29. By the time the famine’s memory had faded, the Bone Courts were not merely present — they were woven in. Their coins circulated in every market, their Houses stood in every quarter, and their Retainers patrolled streets where captains’ men had once walked.
30. And somewhere, in the shadowed rooms of their oldest House, the Court Lords watched and waited, content to let their roots grow deep before the next stage of whatever plan had begun the night the first envoy stepped into the dusk.

## Subchapter 5: The Last Free Port

1. By the time the rest of Dornhal bent to the Bone Courts, only one port remained outside their reach: Greyharbour. Perched on a shelf of rock at the edge of the Outer Caverns, it was a place the Courts found… inconvenient. The channels that led there twisted through narrow, collapsing tunnels, and the harbour itself lay under a ceiling so low that Bone Barges could not raise their long steering oars.
2. Greyharbour smelled of brine and smoke. Every surface seemed damp — from the moss-patched quay stones to the rough timber walls of its warehouses. Lanterns here burned with an orange flame, their oil mixed with pitch to give off a choking smoke that lingered in the air.
3. The port’s survival was owed partly to Harbourmaster Veyra Soll, a woman whose voice could cut through a gale. Her ledger was legend: a tattered book of water-stained vellum pages in which she recorded every arrival and departure, each with notes in a cramped hand no one else could read.
4. Veyra refused Court goods outright. Any cargo suspected of coming from their Houses was burned on the outer shoals, the fire visible for miles down the blackwater channels. She called it “smoke in their eyes.”
5. Greyharbour’s people lived by fishing the coldest reaches of the Underground Sea and trading in lampfish oil — a thick, pale substance that burned bright even in the damp, without the strange aftertaste of Court lamps.
6. Boats here were narrow and sharp-prowed, their hulls tarred black. Crews worked in silence, not from fear, but from a tradition that the fish “listened” and fled noise.
7. The docks were lined with salt racks, heavy with drying cave-crab and thick fillets of eel. In famine years, these stores had kept half the port alive. Even now, they were watched day and night by armed guards.
8. Greyharbour had its own militia, the Netbound, named for the braided rope harnesses they wore across their chests. Their weapons were practical: boarding hooks, harpoons, short recurved bows for fighting in cramped tunnels.
9. The Netbound drilled weekly on the outer quay, their boots thudding in rhythm on the wet planks. Children watched from the warehouse roofs, mimicking their movements with sticks and scraps of netting.
10. The Bone Courts never tried an outright assault. Instead, they sent traders — clean, well-fed, offering silver coins and fine cloth. Veyra would meet them at the pier, listen politely, then tip their goods into the sea.
11. The Courts tried subtler methods. A Greyharbour fisherman once returned from the deep channels with his catch writhing in the nets — not fish, but pale, gasping hands. He cut the nets loose, and the catch sank without a ripple.
12. Poison came next: casks of oil left floating in the channels, their contents fouled with something that made the lamps sputter and go out. The Netbound took to rowing out nightly to smash any casks they found.
13. Greyharbour’s markets were modest: stalls of smoked fish, ropes, oilskin cloaks, and tools made from bone and shell. But they had one prized trade — dried sea-leaf, a rare kelp that brewed into a bitter tea said to sharpen the mind and ward off sleep.
14. The port’s taverns were small, low-ceilinged rooms with soot-dark beams and floors worn smooth by decades of wet boots. The most famous was The Brinewake, run by an ex-smuggler named Torren Clatch, whose shelves held bottles of contraband spirits no one admitted to trading for.
15. In the evenings, the taverns filled with the smell of fried cave-crab and the sound of fiddle tunes played so fast the notes blurred together. Dancers stamped their boots on the planks in time, shaking droplets of seawater from their coats.
16. Greyharbour had its own festivals, too. The Turning of the Net marked the start of each fishing season, when the oldest net in the fleet was patched and cast into the harbour as an offering to the sea. The Bone Courts had nothing like it, and some whispered that the festival’s survival was a quiet act of defiance.
17. The Courts’ spies were not absent, however. Faces changed too quickly in the markets, questions were asked about the militia’s numbers, and strangers lingered too long on the outer quays.
18. Veyra countered with her own network: dockside children who could slip unseen through crowds, tavern-keepers who listened more than they spoke, and ferrymen who would row a stranger into a dead-end channel “by mistake.”
19. Every few months, a fishing boat would fail to return. Sometimes wreckage washed up; sometimes nothing. The older fishers swore the Courts had learned to move along the seabed, sending their barges like shadows under the keel.
20. Greyharbour’s politics were simple on the surface: Veyra at the top, the Netbound as enforcers, and the fishing captains as her council. But beneath, rivalries simmered — between families whose boats had fished the same waters for generations, and younger crews eager to test deeper channels.
21. The Courts played on these divisions. One captain was found with a purse of warm silver coins; another’s son vanished, returning months later with eyes like dull glass and an unshakable loyalty to a “benefactor” in Dornhal.
22. In response, Veyra enforced the One Net Law: no boat could leave the harbour without at least one Netbound aboard. It was protection, but also surveillance. Some captains grumbled; others welcomed it as the only thing keeping them alive.
23. Life in Greyharbour was hard, but its people took pride in being the last place where the Courts’ coin meant nothing. Traders from other freeholds came to swap goods, bringing rumours of how deep the Courts’ control ran elsewhere.
24. Among the more persistent rumours was that the Courts were building something — a portal, a gate, a mouth — in the deepest caverns, and that Greyharbour’s stubborn independence was the last obstacle to completing it.
25. The Netbound found themselves escorting more strangers inland — historians, scavengers, even relic-seekers claiming to look for artefacts of the First Ember. Each was questioned, searched, and shadowed until they left.
26. Greyharbour’s greatest fear was not open attack, but slow strangulation: poisoned channels, corrupted traders, and the loss of allies to the Courts’ bargains.
27. Still, the harbour endured. Its quays creaked under the weight of the catch, its lamps burned with honest oil, and its people could still walk the streets without a Retainer’s shadow falling over them.
28. But there was an unspoken understanding: Greyharbour could not stand forever. Every season brought new pressures, new disappearances, new offers wrapped in silver and bone.
29. And somewhere in Veyra Soll’s private ledger — in the cramped, unreadable hand only she could decipher — was a single entry marked with a red slash: contingency.
30. What that contingency was, no one knew. But the day it was enacted would mark the end of Greyharbour as it had been, and the beginning of whatever lay beyond the last free port’s reach.

## Subchapter 6: The Hidden Way

1. The Hidden Way was never a road in the ordinary sense. It was a path between truths, stitched from scraps of history, half-forgotten maps, and whispers traded in places where the Bone Courts did not yet hold sway.
2. In the common telling, it began as a smugglers’ route from Greyharbour to the abandoned shrine-caves beyond the Outer Caverns. But those who’d walked its full length swore it ran far deeper, ending at a place no map dared to mark.
3. Veyra Soll kept a chart of the first leg, drawn in faint, salt-stained ink on the back of an old fishing licence. It showed the twisting channels of the outer sea, coded with marks that only she and a handful of Netbound could read.
4. From the shrine-caves, the Way became something stranger. Travellers spoke of a causeway of black glass, raised just high enough above the water to keep a walker’s boots dry — if they didn’t trip over the seams between panes.
5. The glass gave off no reflection. Lantern-light slid over it without catching, and footsteps sounded hollow, as though striking not stone, but a lid over something vast and empty.
6. One section of the Way was known as the Vault Steps: a stair of carved basalt that descended into a cavern smelling faintly of burnt resin. Here, the walls were scored with deep grooves, as if something immense had once been chained there and had pulled until the stone split.
7. Old guild ledgers hinted that these steps led to a sealed door — not of wood or iron, but a solid disc of fused bone, warm to the touch and veined with faint light.
8. Legends claimed the door was one of three. The second was lost in the collapse that had buried Cyrinth’s Ascent; the third, if it existed, was said to lie in the Courts’ oldest House, locked behind walls of both stone and oath.
9. Beyond the bone door lay the First Chamber, a vault of obsidian columns. In the centre, a dais of white marble — the only such stone in the underground — stood empty.
10. In one telling, the dais once held the last fragment of the First Ember. In another, it was a throne for the ruler who would command the portal beyond.
11. The portal itself was never described the same way twice. Some called it an arch of shadow that swallowed all light; others said it was a whirlpool in the air, its edges lined with teeth of crystal.
12. What most versions agreed on was that the portal was unfinished. It hung like a wound in the world, shrouded in currents of cold air, and it whispered to those who approached — words in a language no one could recall upon waking.
13. Scholars in exile claimed the portal was a relic of the Age of Umbra, built as a passage to a place where the dead could not follow. The Bone Courts, they warned, sought to complete it for their own ends.
14. The Courts’ interest was the most carefully kept secret in Dornhal. Only a handful of their Retainers had ever been seen in the vicinity of the Hidden Way, and those were always the masked kind — silent, patient, and gone before questions could be asked.
15. Some believed the Courts wanted to close the portal entirely, sealing off a threat from beyond. Others argued the opposite: that they sought to open it fully, to draw something through.
16. Among Greyharbour’s oldest families, there persisted a rite: once a generation, a chosen member would walk as far along the Hidden Way as they dared, carrying a bundle of kelp-wrapped salt and a small lamp. They would return without either, their eyes reflecting the lamp’s pale light for the rest of their lives.
17. The shrine-caves themselves held murals in ochre and ash, depicting figures with ember-bright eyes and shadows shaped like wings. Many were damaged — chipped away, defaced, or eroded by salt spray.
18. In the market, traders sometimes sold shards of black glass said to have been taken from the Way. Held in the hand, they were cool at first, then warmed rapidly, as though matching the holder’s heartbeat.
19. Veyra once admitted — to a single confidant — that the Way was older than Greyharbour, older than the Courts, perhaps even older than the First Ember. “The sea didn’t shape it,” she said. “It was placed here.”
20. She spoke, too, of currents in the outer channels that pulled toward the Way, as if the water itself remembered its course. These currents could drag a boat sideways, set its oars against the tide, and carry it toward the black glass causeway without a hand on the tiller.
21. Not all who sought the Hidden Way did so openly. Bone Court defectors, relic-seekers, and outcasts travelled in disguise, their faces hidden under hooded cloaks, paying for passage with coins that smelled faintly of myrrh.
22. Some never returned. Their names were not spoken in the port again, as if to mention them was to call attention from the wrong quarter.
23. Those who did return often came back changed: older in the face, slower to laugh, their dreams haunted by the sound of stone grinding on stone.
24. One Netbound scout reported finding a length of chain as thick as his arm lying half-buried in the mud along the Way. Each link was fused shut, but the metal was pitted, as though something had tried to eat its way free.
25. Maps of the Way were dangerous things. Veyra kept hers locked in a lead-lined box, claiming that ink left in the open too long would “draw eyes you don’t want on you.”
26. The Bone Courts’ own records — in the rare moments they were glimpsed — referred obliquely to the portal as The Unfurling. Some said this meant a bloom, others a sail, others something less comforting.
27. For the player’s purposes, the Hidden Way exists as a breadcrumb trail: old charts, half-legible inscriptions, and people willing to talk if their trust (or price) is met.
28. The challenge is not merely to find the portal, but to understand its place in the layered history of the underground — First Ember, Age of Umbra, Old Kingdoms, Bone Courts. Every step along the Way risks pulling more of that history into the present.
29. Whatever lies beyond the portal, it has been sought before. The bones of those who failed — human and otherwise — lie in the black water at the edges of the causeway, some so old they crumble to touch.
30. And in the marrow of the world, where the last stretch of the Hidden Way meets the unfinished portal, something stirs — not yet awake, but listening.
