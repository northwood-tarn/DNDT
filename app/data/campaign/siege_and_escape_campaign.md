# Campaign Outline — The Siege and the Escape

**Premise:** Greyharbour — the Last Free Port — is slowly strangled by the Bone Courts through blockade, sabotage, and corruption. In the pressure of the siege, the player uncovers the Hidden Way and descends through layers of history to reach the unfinished portal. The campaign never ventures onto the surface; its triumph is to reach the gate and choose Greyharbour’s fate.

---

## Act I — Siege Begins (Claustrophobic Survival)

**Opening State**
- Greyharbour’s channels are intermittently poisoned; lampfish oil shipments are sabotaged; allies vanish on the outer quays.
- Harbourmaster **Veyra Soll** implements the **One Net Law** (a Netbound aboard every boat).
- The Netbound drill twice daily; food stores are rationed; the smell of smoked eel and pitch hangs over the harbour.

**Player Objectives**
- Investigate blockaded channels and identify the pattern of sabotage (Bone Barges moving “under” currents).
- Expose a Court spy-ring in the market-taverns; choose to publicly try them (stability) or flip them as double agents (intel).

**Key Scenes**
- Night raid on poison casks (boat stealth, lamp control, silent oar strokes).
- Dockside riot over ration cuts; player can de-escalate with presence / evidence / bribe of reserves.
- First encounter with a masked **Court Envoy** offering “pale tokens” in exchange for allegiance.

**Outcomes**
- Harbour’s morale tracked as a living stat: **Bright**, **Sour**, or **Frayed**.
- The player earns trust with Veyra or the Netbound captains (affects Act II access routes).

## Act II — Desperate Measures (Sabotage, Alliances, Consequences)

**State Shift**
- Bone Courts tighten the noose with “benevolent” aid offers; silver coins circulate; Retainers probe the quays.
- The **Ash Circle** revives as an anti-Court alliance of traders; they need proofs and protection.

**Player Objectives**
- Disrupt Court logistics upriver (burn a shadow-warehouse; fake ledgers; redirect Bone Barges into blind channels).
- Secure lampfish oil caches and new fishing grounds in treacherous tunnels.
- Recover famine-era caches (salt, grain, fungus spores) and quell thieves’ guild interference.

**Key Scenes**
- Heist at a bone-inlaid river-house; floor patterns deaden sound but awaken “laboured dead” on misstep.
- Negotiation with defectors: payment in protection and new identities; player sets safehouses.
- Moral choice: free a Court caravan of “raw materials” (the condemned) or turn a blind eye to preserve a covert route.

**Outcomes**
- Three different ways to open Act III: a recovered **Cyrinth-era chart**, a defectors’ **House-maps dossier**, or a Netbound **wayfinder oath** for the outer channels.

## Act III — Descent Through History (Longest Act; Exploration & Revelation)

**Intent:** This act is the sprawling heart: a sequence of branching expeditions that each peel back a layer of the underground’s past, while the siege clock keeps ticking.

**Structure:**
- The player completes **four major expeditions** (in any order), each tied to a historical layer:
  1) **Echoes of the Old Kingdoms** — ruin-delving with cultural puzzles.
  2) **The Veil’s Last Archive** — investigative, social, and codebreaking.
  3) **Famine Roads** — survival travel, foraging logistics, and hard bargains.
  4) **Bone Court Hinterlands** — stealth, sabotage, and witness testimony.

- Completing at least three unlocks **The Hidden Way** expedition — the culminating route to the portal.

### Expedition 1: Echoes of the Old Kingdoms
- **Thalyss Pearl Vault:** waterlogged ropeworks and pearl-mosaic code locks; brine smell and pulley creak; reward: an **Oath-Knot** relic that compels truth in oaths (limited use).
- **Drosven Vent Galleries:** heat-scored basalt, silent forges, gear gates powered by counterweights; reward: a **Vent-Key** that opens stone-fused mechanisms.
- **Marqual Tidal Ledger-House:** driftwood floors, chart riddles, rotating tide-gates to align; reward: **Tide-Ledger** snippet revealing safe currents to the Hidden Way.
- **Lurethis Glass Annex:** cracked brightstone panels, light puzzles; reward: **Prism Sconce** that reveals bone-script hidden inks.
- **Cyrinth Drill Yard:** mirrored Sun-Breaker armour stands; training automata; reward: **Sun-Breaker Vambrace** (flash-blind a small area, limited charges).

### Expedition 2: The Veil’s Last Archive
- Location: mildew-scented **Hall of Nets** annex sealed behind rope-and-ash wards.
- Encounters: mixed patrol rosters, encoded ration ledgers, testimonies from Compact mediators.
- Gameplay: forensic “paper dungeoneering,” ledger matching, oathmark tracing, reconstructing patrol routes to predict Court supply lines.
- Reward: **The Veil Charter Codex** (grants safe-conduct with certain ex-Compact cells) and a map overlay of **safe turns** in Bone Court waters.

### Expedition 3: Famine Roads
- Environment: abandoned lichen farms, sour ferment vats, chalk plague signs.
- Encounters: starving bands, smuggler recipes (communal stews), choice to arm, feed, or recruit.
- Gameplay: travel management (fuel, lamp oil, warmth), campsite hazards, food negotiation.
- Reward: **Salt-Reckoner** (doubles preservation time of provisions) and routes to bypass Court watchposts.

### Expedition 4: Bone Court Hinterlands
- Location: Court-controlled side caverns; Houses with different mask styles.
- Encounters: Retainers with bone-handled blades, laboured dead, quiet feasts.
- Gameplay: social infiltration (faux tokens), timetable-based patrol puzzles, sabotage of coin mints or mask-workshops.
- Reward: **House-Seal Rings** (limited-use access), **Unstamped Silver** (currency leverage), and intelligence on **The Unfurling**.

### Expedition 5 (Unlocked): The Hidden Way
- Features: black glass causeway (no reflection), Vault Steps, bone-fused door warm to the touch.
- Hazards: currents tug the boat sideways; lamp-light dies without warning; chain-scarred walls; “listening” drafts whispering half-words.
- Pivotal Reveal: portal is unfinished and *hungry*; Bone Courts seek to complete it as part of a long design.
- Reward: Access to the **Portal Chamber**; knowledge required to enact the endgame choice.

**Siege Clock:** Between expeditions, the siege advances (supply strain, morale dips, new Court footholds). Successful actions push it back; delays let it advance. This keeps pressure without hard deadlines.

## Act IV — Endgame at the Portal (Decision Under Pursuit)

**Setup**
- The Courts launch their largest pressure campaign yet; Greyharbour’s channels choke; Netbound casualties mount.
- The player’s path along the Hidden Way is compromised; enemy pursuit is inevitable.

**Climactic Space**
- Obsidian columns, bone door, dais of white marble; air cold enough to frost breath; whispering drafts.
- Court Retainers, a masked Envoy, and a half-made “Unfurling” coalesce.

**Choices**
1. **Seal It** — Sacrifice a relic + a life-tied oath; closes the portal; Greyharbour survives diminished but free.
2. **Open It** — Use Court seals & Unfurling rites; draw something through; the Courts change irreversibly (not necessarily in their favour).
3. **Lure Them** — Turn the Courts’ pursuit into the portal; a risky gambit that scatters their leadership but scars the Way.

**Epilogue**
- Morale, alliances, and relics determine which endings play: a battered but independent Greyharbour; a fragile compact of freeholds; or a haunted calm with the Courts’ power broken but not gone.

## Tools for the Text Mode Game

- **Memento Journal:** auto-updating notes with people, places, smells, tastes; doubles as the quest log.
- **Siege Meter:** textual status line (“Lamp oil tight; Veyra terse; Netbound thinned”).
- **Token Economy:** Pale Tokens vs. Free Port chits affect access and suspicion.
- **Skill Challenges:** Low-complexity checks woven into dialogue (“steady the boat,” “decode a ledger,” “keep a crowd calm”).

## GM/Designer Notes

- Keep the *sensory feed* strong: pitch smoke, bitter sea-leaf tea, tarred hulls, myrrh, bone-metal tang.
- Choices should taste of cost: food diverted from one quarter to another, a safehouse burned to protect a route.
- Betrayal hook: one trusted figure (perhaps a Netbound lieutenant) carries a pale token — not as a traitor from the start, but as a desperate survivor who took a gift in a bad season.
