## Act I: Do I Stay or Do I Go?
**NPC:** Militia Captain at the inner gate.  
**Mood:** Bone-tired, wavering between discipline and despair.  

### Step 1
- **Captain:** "The walls tremble. Do we hold, or scatter into the dark?"  
  - **[+1] Player:** "The living matter more than the walls. We must move people out."  
  - **[0] Player:** "It’s not my place to say. You’re the one with command."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "You’ll break either way. Open the gate for me now."  

### Step 2
- **Captain:** "And when they come at you in the night? Will you protect the helpless then?"  
  - **[+1] Player:** "I’ll take civilians myself. Their survival is my oath."  
  - **[0] Player:** "If they follow, I won’t abandon them. But I won’t slow my pace either."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "They’ll only weigh me down. Better they fall here."  

### Step 3
- **Captain:** "So… stay and bleed, or flee and curse me for delay."  
  - **[+1] Player:** "Give me your blessing, and I’ll carve a path for others."  
  - **[0] Player:** "I’ll go — but may your choice buy them time."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "Delay me again, and I’ll cut through you as well as them."  

**Outcomes:**  
- Favorable: Captain tips you to a secret exit (safe route).  
- Neutral: Gate opened late; pursuit follows.  
- Hostile: Captain brands you deserter; combat ensues.

## Act II: The Necromancer’s Bargain
**NPC:** Necromancer surrounded by half-buried corpses.  
**Mood:** Cold pragmatism.  

### Step 1
- **Necromancer:** "The battlefield is mine to command. Will you treat, or oppose me?"  
  - **[+1] Player:** "In dire times, your power is needed. I’ll deal in good faith."  
  - **[0] Player:** "I’ll not call it good, but I’ll hear your terms."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "I’ll not consort with rot and bone."  

### Step 2
- **Necromancer:** "Every boon has a price. What do you offer for safe passage?"  
  - **[+1] Player:** "Your name remembered — the living will know who saved them."  
  - **[0] Player:** "I’ve little to give, only my oath not to cross you."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "I offer nothing. Your power dies with you."  

### Step 3
- **Necromancer:** "Bold. I could turn you into a servant of bone this moment."  
  - **[+1] Player:** "Or ally — choose wisely, and history may yet serve you."  
  - **[0] Player:** "Then we leave each other be. Neither servant nor ally."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "Try, and I’ll scatter your bones myself."  

**Outcomes:**  
- Favorable: Grants relic bone-charm.

### Step 1
- **Leader:** "We ration carefully. What do you bring to my fire?"

  - **[0] Player:** "My hands. I’ll walk, I’ll pull, whatever’s needed."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "You’ll bring what I demand. Share it now."  

### Step 2
- **Leader:** "The pace is slow. Danger presses from behind. Stay or go alone?"  
  - **[+1] Player:** "Together, always. I’ll slow to guard the weak."  
  - **[0] Player:** "I’ll walk with you, but if the end comes, we scatter."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "I won’t crawl with the dying. I go faster alone."  

### Step 3
- **Leader:** "So I ask again — ally, guest, or thief?"  
  - **[+1] Player:** "Ally. Show me your trails, and I’ll shield you from pursuit."  
  - **[0] Player:** "Guest. I’ll walk a while, then part in peace."

  - **[+1] Player:** "Pride blinds you. Turn it to legacy instead."  
  - **[0] Player:** "So the rumors lied. Then I must choose again."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "Your lies are as thin as the air around them."  

### Step 2
- **Villain:** "You seek hope in ashes. What do you cling to now?"  
  - **[+1] Player:** "Knowledge of what’s beyond. Even you can’t stop it."  
  - **[0] Player:** "Survival. For now, that’s enough."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "Cling? No. I’ll drag you down instead."  

### Step 3
- **Villain:** "Then kneel, or burn."  
  - **[+1] Player:** "Neither. Walk with me, or history swallows us both."  
  - **[0] Player:** "I’ll stand. Whatever comes, comes."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "I kneel — so I can strike when you least expect it."  

**Outcomes:**  
- Favorable: Villain stalls, revealing knowledge before battle.  
- Neutral: Illusion collapses, combat begins.

  - **[0] Player:** "Barely enough for me. I won’t take from you, nor give."  
  - **[−1] Player:** "Yours are mine if I want them. Don’t test me."
