# Part II — The Age of Umbra

The Age of Umbra did not begin with a roar.  
It began with a dimming.

The First Ember had always breathed in cycles — brightening into gold, then sinking into darkness — but those darks were once brief pauses in the deep’s pulse, a time to gather close and tell stories until the light returned. Now, the pauses grew long. Villages learned to measure the dark not in hours, but in the number of fires burned down to ash before the Ember’s glow crept back.

And with each return, the light was weaker. What had been gold now carried the dull sheen of cooling iron. Its heat no longer rolled in waves across the underground sea, but wavered like a candle in a draught. The air took on the chill of stone kept too long from the sun, and mist began to cling to the shorelines even during the light.

Along the raft-villages, the ropes that tied hull to hull groaned in the damp, their knots swollen and slick. Mildew became a permanent perfume; it clung to cloaks, nets, even hair. Children grew up with the taste of lichen smoke in their mouths, their lullabies  sung in low voices so as not to carry across the black water.

## The First Shapes

It was during one of the long darks that the first shapes were seen.  
Tall, blurred at the edges, as if the mist itself had thickened into limbs. They moved at the edge of sight, their pace slow and deliberate, and when the torches were turned toward them, they were gone — though the sound of dripping water seemed to follow for hours after.

No one agreed on their form.  
A ferryman swore they were faceless, smooth as river stones.  
A cliff hunter claimed to have seen jointed limbs, bending in unnatural places.  
An old woman described eyes — two pairs, one above the other — glimmering like wet shells.  

Whatever they were, they began to shape life as surely as the dimming Ember.  
Villages drew their rafts closer together. Clifftop rope bridges were torn down or shortened to a single, defensible span. Watchfires burned through entire nights, their wood hauled from miles away, leaving the surrounding tunnels stripped bare.

## The First Necromancy

The practice began as desperation.  
In the cliff-village of Mevril, a sudden squall overturned a netboat, claiming three lives. Among the drowned was a young woman named Caleen, her hair still braided from that morning’s work. Her family brought her to Veylan, the healer — known for drawing water from lungs, for calling back those snatched by the sea.

Caleen rose from the mat without the convulsive gasp of the saved. Her eyes, once the brown of wet kelp, were now the colour of deepwater in torchlight — almost black, with a sheen that seemed to ripple when she moved. She walked again, spoke again, but never smiled. She did not eat, and she did not tire.

The first to see her as a blessing were those with empty nets. A tidebound worker — as the word came to be — could haul and row without pause, could mend in the dark without the need for rest. But the tidebound did not dream, and when they spoke, it was in short, flat tones, as if each word were weighed and found barely worth saying.

**In-world Artefact — “The Cold Bargain” (oral account)**  
*"My son came back to me. He knew my face but not my voice. When I laughed, he tilted his head like a gull. He worked the nets until his fingers tore, and still he worked. One night I saw him standing in the shallows, looking down. I called to him. He did not turn. In the morning, his footprints led into the water and did not return."*

## The Rise of the Night Houses

Necromancy — though still unnamed — spread. Those who could call the tidebound formed secretive alliances, claiming territory along the shores and cliffs. These became the **Night Houses**.  

A House’s word was law in its domain. To be under its banner meant safety from the shapes in the mist, from hunger, from the slow freezing of the long darks. But it came at a cost: in life, years of labour; in death, the surrender of one’s body to the House.

The Houses hoarded not only firewood, fungus, and fish, but the **stories** of the Ember’s light. In their telling, only they had the right to guard its glow. Their halls were carved deep into cliff faces, fronted by gates of driftwood lashed with bone. Inside, oil-lamps burned with the faint hiss of lichen wax, casting light that trembled across walls lined with crests and trophies.

**In-world Artefact — House Charter of the Eighth Dark**  
*To the living: labour, oath, obedience.  
To the dead: service, silence, and return.*

## The Height

When the Age of Umbra reached its height, the dark no longer broke. The Ember’s glow was no more than the ember of its name — a dull red coal behind iron gates, its warmth felt only by those the Houses allowed to approach.

The tidebound filled the tunnels and waterways. They rowed ferries across the black channels in perfect, soundless unison. They guarded the gates, their hands white on pike-shafts. They mended nets in the deep hours, pale eyes reflecting the dimmest lamplight.

The black channels themselves became places of dread. The water there seemed thicker, swallowing light and sound alike. Travellers whispered of long shadows moving beneath the hull, of the faint brush of unseen things against their ankles. The smell of the channels was sharp, with a sweetness that clung to the tongue — the sweetness of rot beneath the brine.

**In-world Artefact — “House Decree, Year of Stillwater”**  
*No vessel may be buried in the soil nor set adrift without the blessing of the House.  
All flesh returns. All flesh serves.*

The First Ember, now a prisoner behind walls, became the heart of the Houses’ power. Some said they fed it offerings: fish, rare minerals, even living captives. Those who returned from its presence spoke of dreams filled with the sound of water rushing in the dark, of standing on a shore made of bone.

The people had adapted so deeply to the dark that they feared the idea of light — yet the Houses dreamed of it. They sent expeditions upward, searching for the surface Embers the old songs promised. Those who returned came back blistered, their eyes streaming even in the deep’s dimness. They spoke of air that burned the lungs and light that stripped the colour from the world.

And in those years, the shadow was not merely the absence of light — it was the fabric of life. It filled the air, lay across the water, settled into the marrow. It was the state of the world.

But the shadow had limits, though none yet could see them.  
And beyond those limits, change was waiting.

## Life in the Age of Umbra — Fragments and Details

The long dark was not a season; it was the air you breathed.  
It shaped gestures, voices, even the way people stood.  
When someone spoke to you, they did so at close range, their breath clouding between you, their hand lightly gripping your arm so you knew they were still there. When parting, people lingered in silence for a few heartbeats before turning away — as if the dark might swallow them the instant they left your sight.

---

**Overheard on a ferry across the Black Channel**  
*"Don’t watch the water. Don’t let it know you’re here."*  
*"The water can’t know—"*  
*"It can. It will."*

Fishmongers worked by touch as much as sight, their fingers sliding along scales to feel for disease. In the glow of the fungus-market, shadows of hooks and knives stretched across walls hung with drying kelp. The smell was sharp — salt, iron, and the faint reek of oil pressed from deep-water eels.

In cliff-hollows, children learned to tie knots before they could write their names. Rope was life: it bound rafts together, held cargo against the currents, and anchored ladders to the cliff face. The Night Houses taxed rope as they taxed fish — paid in coils, knotted at one end to mark the maker.

**In-world Artefact — Fragment of a lullaby from Mevril**  
*Little fish in the water’s bend,  
Hide your light and still your fin.  
Dark comes fast, the rope will send  
Mother’s hand to pull you in.*  

---

Oil-lamps hissed and popped as they burned lichen wax. The flame was always small, low, a petal of light. Too bright a flame was wasteful and dangerous — it could draw things from the mist. Even in House halls, the richest rooms never saw more than a dozen lamps at once.

The tidebound passed through daily life like ghosts. They did not move quickly, but they moved without pause. People stepped aside without thinking, letting them pass as one might let a current flow around you. The living rarely touched them; their skin was cold and faintly slick, like a stone lifted from underwater.

**In-world Artefact — Market notice, written in ochre on dried kelp**  
*By order of House Velth: No sale of brightstone without House tithe. No light without loyalty.*

The mists carried sound strangely. A song sung in one hollow might drift across the water and arrive in another hours later, thinned and warped. Some claimed to hear their own voices return to them, altered — the same words, but spoken in a flat, cold tone like the tidebound.

Ferry crossings were quiet affairs. The only rhythm was the knock of oars against the hull and the occasional drip from the cavern roof. Even whispers seemed to linger too long. Children were warned never to trail their hands in the water; those who did claimed to feel something smooth and strong brush against their fingers.

---

**In-world Artefact — Snippet of conversation in the fungus-market**  
*"Heard about the Stillwater crew?"*  
*"Aye. All gone in the night. Boat was there in the morning, empty but for oars."*  
*"Tidebound now, most like."*  

---

In these ways — through the tang of lichen smoke, the weight of mist on the skin, the sound of water folding in on itself in the dark — the Age of Umbra pressed itself into every life. Even those who tried to forget the shapes in the mist, or the rules of the Houses, carried the shadow with them.  

The darkness was not only the setting of life; it was its texture.  
It tasted of brine and mildew, felt of damp rope and stone, and sounded like a breath taken in fear but never released.
