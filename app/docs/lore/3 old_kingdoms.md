# Part III — The Old Kingdoms (Interlinked Chronicle)

The Age of Umbra did not end with a sudden break; its shadows simply learned new shapes.  
From the mist-shrouded halls of the Night Houses came new powers, each holding some fragment — literal or imagined — of the First Ember’s legacy. In time, they became the Five Old Kingdoms, rising one after the other, each from the bones of the last.

## I. Thalyss, the Pearl-Chain Kingdom

**Dates:** c. 120 AU – 290 AU  
**Capital:** Drommath, a cliff-ringed harbour strung with rope bridges, pearl-lamps glowing faintly over the tide.

The six raft-clans of the Sheltered Reaches united under Queen Imera Thalyss in the *Cord Oath*, each chieftain wearing a knotted rope token cut from the same strand. In the early days, Drommath’s air smelled of brine and hot pitch, and the harbour clanged with pulley wheels and shouting divers. The pearls they harvested — pale spheres warm to the touch — became the kingdom’s lifeblood, traded as currency far beyond its borders.

**Key Figures:**  
- **Queen Imera Thalyss**, *the Rope-Cutter*. Said to have ordered rival fleets’ moorings cut in the night, letting them drift into blackwater.  
- **Master-Builder Kael Vorren**, architect of the Hanging Markets, where traders haggled on swaying planks high above the spray.

**Collapse:** The red tide came in a season of plenty. The Sheltered Reaches turned the colour of blood; mollusc beds died in weeks. With no pearls to fund its debts, Thalyss fractured. The Cord Oath itself was burned in Drommath’s square, the smoke bitter with squid ink.

**To the next kingdom:**  
Among the chaos, smith-guilds from the deeper reaches arrived to collect unpaid debts. They brought with them rumours of a place where heat still breathed — a volcanic vent large enough to forge an empire’s worth of metal. As Thalyss’s fleets rotted at their moorings, those guilds withdrew to that vent, founding Drosven.

**In-world Artefact — Tax Ledger Page (water-damaged)**  
*“…three coils rope, six pearls, one silver hook. Payment deferred — red tide approaching.”*

**Overheard at the last Hanging Market:**  
*"Pearls are light in the hand, heavy in the debt."*  
*"Heavier now they’re gone."*

## II. Drosven, the Vent-Forged Realm

**Dates:** c. 250 AU – 415 AU  
**Capital:** Karr-Vest, carved into the basalt wall of a volcanic vent chamber.

Here, the air shimmered with heat and the smell of scorched brine. The clang of hammers on vent-metal never ceased; molten sparks fell like fireflies into the vent’s roar. The Law of Heat, enforced by Guildmaster Orran Hask, forbade any unmarked hand from drawing water or ore from the Sacred Vent.

**Key Figures:**  
- **Orran Hask**, *the Iron Speaker*, whose word was law among the smiths.  
- **Rel and Vora**, the Ember-Sworn Twins, mercenaries whose brightstone-edged swords steamed in the cold.

**Collapse:** An earthquake sealed the vent in a single night. The heat bled away; frost crept over Karr-Vest’s gates. Drosven’s armies, once feared, found their weapons brittle and their morale colder still.

**To the next kingdom:**  
With the vent sealed, Drosven’s pilots turned to the mid-Sea to trade for food and fuel. There they encountered a loose confederation of river-pilots, whose charts mapped currents no one else dared sail. Drosven’s collapse left a power vacuum in the mid-Sea, and those pilots, led by Halven Marr, bound their rafts into the kingdom of Marqual.

*“…and no hand unmarked by the Guild shall dip rope or vessel in the Sacred Vent, on pain of fire and hammer.”*

## III. Marqual, the Flooded Crown

**Dates:** c. 400 AU – 560 AU  
**Capital:** Istral-on-the-Water, a city of raft-tiers lashed to pillars sunk deep in the current.

The smell of wet rope and boiled crab hung over the markets. River-pilots shouted to each other across the tide-gates, selling safe passage through channels whose moods they knew like kin. The Flooded Crown library-palace stored every chart, its driftwood floors polished smooth by generations of wet boots.

**Key Figures:**  
- **King Halven Marr**, the Crowned Pilot, whose rope crown was said to quiver with changes in the current.  
- **Archivist Pryn Vel**, inventor of the Tidal Ledger, recording tolls in both coin and safe-passage rights.

**Collapse:** Fires consumed the Flooded Crown in one night. The smell of lamp-oil on the water hinted at sabotage. Without their charts, Marqual’s tolls crumbled; rivals claimed the currents.

**To the next kingdom:**  
Among the refugees were brightstone engineers who had long petitioned for space to build their “light shell.” Freed from Marqual’s cautious councils, they travelled east to a warm-water cavern, raising the Glass Dome that would become Lurethis.

## IV. Lurethis, the Glass-Domed Throne

**Dates:** c. 540 AU – 710 AU  
**Capital:** Selven-Dome, a hemisphere of fused brightstone, its air constant-warm, scented with citrus from hothouse groves.

Markets under the Dome sold silks, fresh fruit, and caged ember-flames. At night, light spilled through the brightstone shell, turning the surrounding waters pale as milk. Prince Veyran’s Light Hunts — chasing ember-flames across the Sea — became a courtly sport.

**Key Figures:**  
- **Arch-Constructor Nellis Dre**, who lost three fingers to molten brightstone raising the Dome.  
- **Prince Veyran**, whose private collection of caged flames was said to rival the Dome’s public lights.

**Collapse:** A quake cracked the Dome’s base; the sea poured in, scattering light “like coins in the current.” Survivors clung to upper galleries for months before the final breach.

**To the next kingdom:**  
The refugees who escaped carried tales of a tunnel to the upper world — a story brought by scouts who had mapped far beyond Lurethis’s reach. They rallied under Queen Rhenn Cyrinth, founding a fortress at the tunnel mouth: Dornhal.

*One basket blood-orange — three bolts silk — two lantern-flames (caged). Paid in brightstone coin.*

## V. Cyrinth, the Last Kingdom

**Dates:** c. 680 AU – 812 AU  
**Capital:** Dornhal, a fortress city of drills and dreams at the mouth of the only known tunnel to the surface.

Here, armourers forged Sun-Breaker plate — mirrored to “turn aside the surface sun.” Children climbed rope-lattices as high as the cavern roof, training for the day of Ascent. The Hall of Memory guarded the copper-coloured Cyrinth Fragment, believed to be a shard of the First Ember.

**Key Figures:**  
- **Queen Rhenn Cyrinth**, the Ember-Bearer, who promised the sky.  
- **Marshal Tor Velas**, designer of the Sun-Breaker armour.  
- **High Voice Dren Malcor**, preacher of the Ascent.

**Collapse:** In 812 AU, the Ascent was attempted with 300 soldiers and the Queen herself. The tunnel collapsed before they broke through. Faith shattered; Dornhal dissolved into petty realms — the fragile, quarrelling territories of the present day.

**Dockside Whisper, post-collapse:**  
*"The Queen made it through. She just didn’t come back."*
